# About

OpenDiT is an open-source project that provides a high-performance implementation of Diffusion Transformer(DiT) powered by [Colossal-AI](https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI). Specifically designed to enhance the efficiency of training and inference for DiT applications involving text-to-video and text-to-image generation.

OpenDiT boasts the following characteristics:

1. Up to 2x-3x speedup and 50% memory reduction on GPU
      * Kernel optimization including FlashAttention, Fused AdaLN, and Fused layernorm kernel.
      * Hybrid parallelism methods including ZeRO, Gemini, and DDP. And shard ema model to further reduce memory cost.
2. FastSeq: A novel sequence parallelism method
    * Sepcially designed for DiT-like workload where activation is large but parameter is small.
    * Up to 48% communication save for intra-node sequence parallel.
    * Break the memory limit of single GPU and reduce the overall training and inference time.
3. Ease of use
    * Huge performance gains with a few lines changes
    * You don't need to care about how the parallel part is implemented
4. Complete pipeline of text-to-image and text-to-video generation
    * User can easily use and adapt our pipeline to their own research without modifying the parallel part.
    * Verify the accuracy of OpenDiT with text-to-image training on ImageNet and release checkpoint.

## Installation

Prerequisites:

-   Python >= 3.10
-   PyTorch >= 1.13 (We recommend to use a >2.0 version)
-   CUDA >= 11.6

We strongly recommend you use Anaconda to create a new environment (Python >= 3.10) to run our examples:

```shell
conda create -n opendit python=3.10 -y
conda activate opendit
```

Install ColossalAI:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI.git
cd ColossalAI
git checkout adae123df3badfb15d044bd416f0cf29f250bc86
pip install -e .
```

Install OpenDiT:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/oahzxl/OpenDiT
cd OpenDiT
pip install -e .
```

(Optional but recommend) Install libraries for training & inference speed up:

```shell
# Install Triton for fused adaln kernel
pip install triton

# Install FlashAttention
pip install flash-attn

# Install apex for fused layernorm kernel
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex.git
cd apex
git checkout 741bdf50825a97664db08574981962d66436d16a
pip install -v --disable-pip-version-check --no-cache-dir --no-build-isolation --config-settings "--build-option=--cpp_ext" --config-settings "--build-option=--cuda_ext" ./ --global-option="--cuda_ext" --global-option="--cpp_ext"

```


## Usage
### Image Pipeline
```
# train
bash train_img.sh
# inference
bash sample.sh
```
### Video Pipeline
```
# train

```

## Core Design
### Efficient Sequence Parallelism -- （AllGanther）

### Overlapped QKV

### Distributed Attention

### Communication Complexity Analysis

## DiT Reproduction Result

We have trained DiT using the origin method with OpenDiT to verify our accuracy. We have trained the model from scratch on ImageNet for 80k steps. And here are some results generated by our trained DiT:

Our loss also aligns with the results listed in the paper:
